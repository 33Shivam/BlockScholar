# Project Block Scholar

### Inspiration
The early inspiration of the project is from the recent Russia Ukraine War. During the war the economy of the country crashes. The indian students who were studying in the country were made to return back to India
with no support for their countinued education back home. This combined with non-trasparency in current scholarship distribution process made us to believe that a decentralized solution was needed in this sector.
